# OOP-Final_Project
Build and Publish a Python Library for Data Science

🎯 Objective Create and publish a Python library (package) that applies Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to a data science application. You will collaborate as a group, manage your project on GitHub, and publish your package to PyPI, complete with documentation.

# Folders
- Fanal PRoject/ — chosen library implementation
- Report/ — weekly narrative reports and peer evaluations
- Documentation / — UML, screenshots, and design materials
