# Introduction
For the first week of our OOP final project, our group officially began the development of DataMedic, a Python-based data cleaning library designed to assist students, beginners in data science, data scientists and analysts in diagnosing and treating common dataset issues. The library aims to embody key object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and the use of dunder methods. DataMedic will serve as a diagnostic and treatment tool that inspects, cleans, and reports on dataset health—offering a unique, medical-inspired approach to data quality management.

# Objectives for the Week
In Week 1, our team built the foundation for DataMedic, a Python software that inspects, diagnoses, and resolves common data quality concerns such as missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers. Laying the groundwork for everything that follows.

This week, our group developed the concept for our library and designed it utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. We designed our process for the following stages of development, created a UML diagram to visualize the class hierarchy, and set up a GitHub repository for collaboration. Members were assigned responsibilities, and We looked into current data cleaning methods for suggestions and references.

# Narrative of Activities
This week, our group worked on our project called DataMedic, which focuses on data cleaning and management. We applied OOP concepts to design the system structure and created a UML diagram to show the class relationships. We also set up a GitHub repository for collaboration and assigned each member specific tasks. Our group researched existing data cleaning methods for inspiration and planned the next stages of our development process.

# Challenges Encountered
Our group struggled for days, trying to figure out how to start our OOP Final Project. We did not know what type of structure should be followed by the program, nor how to correctly apply the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. It also took time for us to organize our ideas, understand the class hierarchy, and figure out how to begin coding.

# Reflection and Learning
Throughout the first week of developing DataMedic, our group gained a deeper understanding of how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) can be applied to real-world software development. Initially, we struggled with structuring our project and determining how to implement concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. However, as we collaborated, discussed ideas, and studied various data cleaning libraries, we gradually learned how these OOP principles could work together to build a modular and scalable system.

We realized that designing before coding is crucial. Creating a UML diagram helped us visualize the relationships between classes and clarified how different components of the library should interact. Setting up a GitHub repository also improved our teamwork by allowing us to collaborate more efficiently, track progress, and manage updates.

This week’s experience taught us the importance of planning, communication, and research before jumping into implementation. We learned that even though coding is a core part of development, understanding the logic, structure, and purpose behind each class and function is what makes a program truly effective. Overall, the process strengthened our teamwork, enhanced our problem-solving skills, and gave us confidence to move forward with developing DataMedic in the upcoming weeks.
