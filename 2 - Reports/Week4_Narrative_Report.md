# Narrative Report — Week 4

**Date Covered:** November 24 – November 28, 2025  
**Course:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
**Project Title:** CleanOps: A Python Library for Data Cleaning

# Documentation & Collaboration

During Week 4, we focused on wrapping up the project for launch this meant sorting out all required documents while making sure the code was tidy and publish-ready. A key step forward was finishing the **"README"** file it now holds a brief summary of the project, setup directions, practical examples, and licensing details. The file clarifies what CleanOps aims to do, lists the toolkit's capabilities, and gives short Python snippets showing dataset checks, auto-cleaning actions, report creation, and end-to-end pipeline execution. Furthermore, installation guidance was structured into clear sections, covering both pip-based and manual source setups.

This week, the team went through the full repository removing duplicate files while verifying module alignment with docs. **The setup.py** and **LICENSE** files were completed, along with additional required assets for distribution. As a result, project structure met requirements and stood prepared for deployment.
Week 4 focused on clear structure and fine-tuning. Since the README was finished and the repo cleaned up.

# Cleaning and Organizing the Repository
We also worked on cleaning up the entire repository of the project to be properly structured for release: removing duplicate or unused files, checking the arrangement of folders, and placing all modules in correct directories. We systematized filenames and rearranged all the assets so that the project would be more navigable for any future user. Furthermore, we checked consistency within this repository, making sure every file followed some sort of uniform naming style, and there were no temporary or obsolete test files remaining in it. At the end of this process, the project folder was more orderly, readable, and ready for packaging.

# Reviewing and Refining All Code
Other important work to be done during Week 4 was to review the entire codebase for consistency, functionality, and documentation. We looked at every class and function, updated docstrings detailing their behavior, and then removed redundant comments or unnecessary imports. The team fixed formatting issues, unified naming conventions, and made sure that example code present in README matched the actual implementation. We also ran all code snippets included in the documentation to ensure that they executed without errors. This refinement phase enhanced clarity, readability, and reliability for the project in preparation for its final release.
