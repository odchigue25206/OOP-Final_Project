**Date Covered:** December 1 – December 5, 2025  
**Course:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
**Project Title:** CleanOps: A Python Library for Data Cleaning

# Publishing & Presentation
Deployment and project showcasing marked the final stage of the CleanOps development lifecycle, concentrated in Week 5 for the team. The key tasks were to publish the library for public use, test the installation procedures, and prepare a brief presentation of the project.

Jave published the CleanOps package to PyPI, which is pip installable. The team ensured the deployment was reliable by installing and upgrading the library with the official PyPI repository in a clean Python environment. Installation and upgrade tests showed that all the dependencies required (like pandas and numpy) were correctly resolved and the package worked as expected after being installed.

demonstrating pip install cleanops ran correctly also showing pip install **upgrade cleanops** completed without issues; dependency management happened automatically during the process. The prior version was removed smoothly before the new one installed successfully.
These records confirm the CleanOps package works well within typical Python setups, integration requires minimal effort overall.

After going live, we checked the code and docs carefully - matching what’s online with the repo copy. Version tags, required packages, and if modules load right were all confirmed. Screenshots showing clean installs proved the build runs without issues.
The team also created a 5–7 minute overview, outlining the project's goal, main functions, build stages, along with results from going live. It showed how CleanOps makes routine data cleanup easier - while underlining the benefit of sharing a tool others can use.
Week 5 ended with CleanOps deployed successfully - verification followed, then presented; this closed the project while showing solid teamwork alongside working tech.
